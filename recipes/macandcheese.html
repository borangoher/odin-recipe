        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1+½ cups Borden® Triple Cheddar Natural Shreds</li>
            <li>1 cup Borden® Colby Jack Natural Shreds</li>
            <li>2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Borden® Butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup Borden® Vitamin D Milk</li>
            <li>1 cup Borden® Half & Half</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the inside of a 1 1/2-quart 
                casserole dish with non-stick cooking spray. Combine Cheddar 
                and Colby Jack cheeses in a medium bowl and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Cook macaroni in boiling salted water according to package directions; 
                drain well and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Blend in flour, 
                stirring constantly, until smooth and bubbly. Gradually whisk in milk and 
                half & half. Stir constantly, until mixture boils and thickens 
                (about 2 to 3 minutes). Remove from heat and add cayenne and black 
                peppers, and 2 cups of the reserved cheese mixture; stir until cheese 
                is melted and sauce is smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Stir cooked macaroni into the sauce and season to taste. 
                Place in the prepared casserole dish. Top with remaining 1/2 
                cup of cheese and dot with additional butter, if desired. 
                Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until heated through and lightly browned.</li>
